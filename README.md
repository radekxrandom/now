(Under development) Website I've made for my friend in order to create a unique and personal listening experience to an extra track from his album. In order to listen to the song you have to contact him to receive an acces code (valid for limited time). There are measures in place to discourage the users from downloading the track.

Disclaimer: the text in Polish that's displayed on this website wasn't written by me. It was written by my friend for whom I am creating this site.

Main page. Text written by my friend. Edit and stop editing buttons are visible only to superusers.

There is a neat CMS written by me in place. There is quick edit option on every page (after you click edit button on the top).

To receive acces code there is a special form on /form.

Przed and po are going to look similiar.

Teraz will play my friend's track. It will play it only once and block acces afterwards. I am going to try to deter users from downloading the track.
Acces code is going to be valid for only one listen and expire 3 days after being used.

I tried to make design responsive
